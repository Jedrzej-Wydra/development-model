# A NEW WAY TO CALCULATE THERMAL SUMMATION CONSTANTS FOR FORENSICALLY USEFUL INSECTS USING FUZZY REGRESSION

#### authors: Jędrzej Wydra, Szymon Matuszewski

## History
This project had a rocky start, but it ultimately turned into a valuable experience that I’m proud of. The initial concepts, while they didn’t pan out as planned, gave me the opportunity to dive deep into fuzzy regression — a challenging but rewarding area of study. Although those early ideas were eventually set aside, they laid the groundwork for the next iteration, which will be published soon. This version leverages advanced methods like finite mixture models, the EM algorithm, and even MCMC algorithms during testing.

At present, you can find a poster in this repository that showcases the canceled version of the project. More details will be released soon, including the abstract, Python scripts, a pre-print, and a GUI program designed for non-technical users.
